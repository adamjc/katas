KOTD: 


Move all vowels of a word to the start or end of the word depending on their order, 
if the vowel is closer to the start of the word than the end it should be at the start of the word and vice versa. 


e.g. Hello
ehllo


Maneuver
aeMnvrue 


The order of the vowels matters too such as in the previous example 'a' is the first vowel in the first half 
of the word so is the first character.
